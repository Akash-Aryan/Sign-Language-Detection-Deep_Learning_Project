Welcome to the Sign Language Detection project! This deep learning-based system is designed to recognize hand gestures representing alphabets in sign language. It uses image classification techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify and interpret hand gestures, bridging communication gaps for the hearing and speech impaired.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary goals of this project are:

* 🤖 Develop a deep learning model to classify static hand gestures
* 🧠 Train the model on a diverse dataset of American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets
* 📦 Save and deploy the model for inference
* 📸 Explore integration with real-time image/video inputs using OpenCV

---

## 🎥 Demo (Coming Soon)

🔜 A demo video or GIF will be added here to show the real-time detection in action.

## 📦 Requirements

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install key packages:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

---

## 📸 Dataset Overview

The dataset used includes images of hand signs representing English alphabets (A–Z). Each folder is labeled by the alphabet it represents.

### 🏷️ Sample Format:

```bash
Hand-Gesture-Dataset/
├── A/
│   ├── img1.jpg
│   ├── img2.jpg
│   └── ...
├── B/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

### 📊 Suggested Preprocessing:

* Resize to `64x64` or `128x128`
* Normalize pixel values to \[0, 1]
* Apply image augmentation (rotation, flipping, etc.) for generalization

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

A CNN model was used due to its excellent performance in image classification tasks.

### ✅ Model Summary:

* **Input Layer**: `64x64x3` RGB image
* **Conv2D + ReLU**
* **MaxPooling2D**
* **Conv2D + ReLU**
* **MaxPooling2D**
* **Flatten**
* **Dense (128) + ReLU**
* **Output Layer (26 units) + Softmax**

### 💻 Compiling the Model:

```python
model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='categorical_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)
```

---

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training Process

### 📚 Training Script Steps:

1. **Load Dataset**
2. **Preprocess Images** (resize, normalize)
3. **Label Encode** alphabets
4. **Split Data** into training and testing sets
5. **Define CNN model**
6. **Train the model** using `model.fit()`
7. **Evaluate and Save** using `.evaluate()` and `.save()`

### 🧪 Evaluation Metrics:

* Accuracy
* Loss (training vs validation)
* Confusion Matrix (optional)

---

## 📊 Results

| Metric              | Value (Example) |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| Training Accuracy   | 96.5%           |
| Validation Accuracy | 93.2%           |
| Final Test Accuracy | 91.7%           |
| Epochs              | 15              |
| Model Size          | \~2.3 MB        |

📈 Use `matplotlib` to plot training vs validation curves:

```python
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'])
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'])
plt.legend(['train', 'val'])
plt.title('Model Accuracy')
```

---

## 📽️ Real-Time Prediction

💡 Add webcam support using OpenCV for live gesture recognition:

```python
import cv2
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
# Capture frames, detect ROI, preprocess, and predict using model.predict()
```

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* 🖥️ Real-time GUI using Tkinter or Streamlit
* 🌐 Web deployment using Flask/FastAPI
* 🤳 Mobile App using TensorFlow Lite
* 🧠 Use Transfer Learning (e.g., MobileNetV2) for better performance
* 🧾 Add multi-language gesture support (ISL, BSL, etc.)
