![9AP7Hn_V_oPorT5JRLn1GHBIO5I](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93e7aa7a-b246-4332-812c-48f1225a9c04)


Welcome to the Sign Language Detection project — a powerful image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect hand gestures that represent alphabets in American Sign Language (ASL). This deep learning project can be used to aid communication for the hearing or speech impaired.

## 📦 Requirements

Install all required dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Main libraries used:

* `tensorflow`, `keras` – Deep Learning
* `opencv-python` – Image capture & processing
* `scikit-learn` – Metrics and preprocessing
* `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Data visualization
* `numpy`, `pandas` – Data handling

---

## 📸 Dataset Overview
![all-symbols](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bbeb289-c43c-4018-a171-f063c4d420d5)


* Static images of hand gestures representing ASL alphabets (A to Z)
* Images are stored in subfolders named by class labels (e.g., `A/`, `B/`, …)
* Sample size may vary per class

🧹 **Preprocessing Steps:**

* Resize to `64x64` or `128x128`
* Normalize pixel values
* Encode labels to one-hot vectors

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

Baseline CNN Model:

```python
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(26, activation='softmax')  # 26 output classes (A–Z)
])
```

✔️ Compiled with:

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', 
              loss='categorical_crossentropy', 
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

---

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training Process

1. Load dataset from directory
2. Resize & normalize images
3. Split into training, validation, and test sets
4. Train model using `model.fit()`
5. Save trained model for future predictions

📂 Output saved in the `model/` folder.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Use `scikit-learn` to evaluate model performance:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_true, y_pred_classes))
```

✅ Includes:

* Accuracy
* Precision / Recall / F1-score
* Confusion Matrix

---

## 🔄 Data Augmentation

To improve generalization, the model uses:

```python
ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=10,
    width_shift_range=0.1,
    height_shift_range=0.1,
    shear_range=0.1,
    zoom_range=0.1,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    fill_mode='nearest'
)
```

📌 **Why?** Prevents overfitting and mimics real-world hand variation.

---

## 🚀 Transfer Learning (Optional)

For better accuracy and faster convergence, consider:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2
```

📌 Benefits:

* Pre-trained on ImageNet
* Requires fewer training samples
* Smaller size for mobile deployment

---

## 📽️ Real-Time Prediction

Use OpenCV to capture webcam input and make live predictions:

```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    # Crop, preprocess and predict with model
```

🔧 Real-time prediction requires:

* ROI extraction
* Frame preprocessing
* Model inference

---

## 📤 Deployment Ideas

* 🖥️ **Web App**: Use Flask, FastAPI or Streamlit
* 📱 **Mobile App**: Convert to `.tflite` for Android
* 🔌 **API**: Expose model via REST endpoint
* 🧠 **Edge Devices**: Raspberry Pi with PiCamera
